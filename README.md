- Start a libreoffice with the correct command line to allow remote access
- Start a logging session using this libreoffice
- Stop this logging session

- compile using gradle: `./gradlew build`

This should result in all necessasry jars ending up in `lib`.

Run like this: 

`java -cp "./lib/*" test.Main`

This should print the usage: 

    Usage: [ startoffice | startsession | stopsession ]

Next try the following: 

`java -cp "./lib/*" test.Main startoffice`
